        ## Description
        
        RLGame is a package provides multi-agent implementation of some classic games for Reinforcement Learning (RL).
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        * pip
        * numpy
        * matplotlib
        
        ## Getting start
        
        Take "snake" for example:
        
        ```python
        import RLGame
        env = RLGame.make("snake")
        state = env.reset()
        env.display(ticks=0.01)
        
        for _ in range(1000):
            action = env.action_space.sample_choice()
            state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
            if done:
                break
            env.display(ticks=0.01)
        print(f"score: {env.get_score()}")
        ```
        
        where ```state``` (np.ndarray) is the environment state, ```reward``` (int or float) is the reward from this action, ```done``` (boolean) is a signal which identify whether the game has ended, and ```info``` (dict) is for debugging.
